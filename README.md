# Claude Code Config

Claude Code configuration for full-stack web3/AI engineers. TypeScript/React + Solidity + Rust + multi-chain.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- Python 3 (for hooks)
- jq (for todo-enforcer hook): `brew install jq`

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samueldanso/claude-code-config.git
cd claude-code-config
./install.sh
```

The installer will:

1. Check prerequisites
2. Detect compound-engineering plugin
3. Backup existing `~/.claude/` config
4. Copy all files to `~/.claude/`
5. Register hooks in `settings.json`
6. Verify installation

### Manual Install

```bash
# Copy everything to ~/.claude/
cp CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/
cp -r agents/ ~/.claude/agents/
cp -r skills/ ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r rules/ ~/.claude/rules/
cp -r commands/ ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r hooks/ ~/.claude/hooks/

# Make hooks executable
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/*.py ~/.claude/hooks/*.sh
```

Then manually add hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/keyword-detector.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/check-comments.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ~/.claude/hooks/todo-enforcer.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Selective Install

Only want specific skills? Copy individual directories:

```bash
# Just the Solidity skills
cp -r skills/solidity-security/ ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/web3-foundry/ ~/.claude/skills/
cp rules/solidity.md ~/.claude/rules/

# Just the React skills
cp -r skills/react-useeffect/ ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/vercel-react-best-practices/ ~/.claude/skills/

# Just a single chain
cp -r skills/web3-megaeth/ ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/web3-monad/ ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Customization

### Adding a New Chain

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/web3-YOUR-CHAIN/
```

Create a `SKILL.md` inside:

```markdown
---
name: web3-your-chain
description: Your Chain development reference. Use when deploying to or building on Your Chain.
---

# Your Chain Reference

## Chain Configuration

| Property | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Chain ID | ...   |
| RPC URL  | ...   |
| Explorer | ...   |
| Faucet   | ...   |

## Deployment Patterns

...
```

Then add it to two places:

1. `CLAUDE.md` — add a row to the skill trigger table
2. `rules/forge.md` — add a row to the chain configuration table

### Modifying Rules

Rules in `rules/` are auto-loaded based on the file path you're editing. The `paths:` frontmatter controls when they activate:

```yaml
---
paths: "**/*.sol" # Activates when editing any .sol file
---
```

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Only activate in a specific directory
paths: "contracts/**/*.sol"

# Activate for multiple extensions
paths: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"

# Activate for test files only
paths: "**/*.{test,spec}.ts, **/__tests__/**"

# Activate for config files
paths: "foundry.toml, hardhat.config.ts"
```

To create a new rule, add a `.md` file to `rules/` with the frontmatter and your rules below it.

### Adding a New Keyword Mode

Edit `hooks/keyword-detector.py` and add an `elif` block:

```python
elif re.search(r'\b(your-keyword|alias)\b', prompt):
    additional_context = """
[YOUR MODE ACTIVATED]

Instructions that get injected into Claude's context when triggered...
"""
```

### Adjusting the Comment Checker

Edit `hooks/check-comments.py`:

- `MAX_COMMENT_RATIO` — change the threshold (default 25%)
- `VALID_PATTERNS` — add patterns that should NOT be flagged (e.g., your custom annotations)
- `CODE_EXTENSIONS` — add/remove file extensions to check

### Adding a New Command

Create a `.md` file in `commands/`:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash
argument-hint: [your-args]
description: What this command does
---

Instructions for Claude when the user runs /your-command...
```

Usage: `/your-command [args]` in any Claude Code session.

### Adding a New Skill

Create a directory in `skills/` with a `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill
description: When to use this skill. Be specific — Claude uses this to decide when to auto-invoke.
---

# Your Skill

Reference content, patterns, code examples...
```

Set `disable-model-invocation: true` in the frontmatter if the skill should only run when manually invoked (not auto-triggered).

## Usage Examples

### Keyword Modes

Type these words anywhere in your prompt to activate specialized behavior:

```
ultrawork implement the staking contract
```

Activates maximum parallel execution, comprehensive planning, todo tracking.

```
analyze why the approve function reverts on Base
```

Activates deep investigation protocol with multi-phase analysis.

```
security review the vault contract
```

Routes to security scanning with Solidity-specific checks (reentrancy, CEI, access control).

```
deploy the NFT contract to Base mainnet
```

Activates deployment protocol — confirms chain, runs pre-deploy checks, verifies after.

All keyword modes:

| Keyword              | What Happens                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ultrawork` / `ulw`  | Maximum parallel execution, comprehensive planning      |
| `search` / `find`    | Exhaustive multi-angle search                           |
| `analyze` / `debug`  | Deep investigation with evidence gathering              |
| `think deeply`       | Extended reasoning with trade-off analysis              |
| `refactor`           | Incremental changes, behavior preservation, tests first |
| `review`             | Routes to appropriate reviewer agent                    |
| `test`               | BDD structure, edge cases, fuzz testing                 |
| `optimize`           | Gas optimization (Solidity) or bundle/perf (React)      |
| `security` / `audit` | Security scan (Solidity-specific or general)            |
| `deploy`             | Deployment protocol with chain awareness                |

### Commands

```
/audit contracts/Vault.sol
```

Runs a structured security audit: static analysis, access control, reentrancy, economic vectors, gas DoS, events, NatSpec.

```
/deploy-check base MyToken
```

Pre-deployment verification: chain config, constructor args, proxy setup, post-deploy checks. Returns GO/NO-GO.

```
/interview docs/feature-spec.md
```

Interactive interview to flesh out a plan or spec. Asks deep questions about implementation, UX, tradeoffs.

```
/ui-expert
```

Locks Claude into pixel-perfect UI mode. Treats the reference design as the single source of truth — no creativity, no improvements, exact match only.

### Skills Auto-Invoke

Skills trigger automatically based on what you're doing:

- Edit a `.sol` file → Solidity rules load + security skill available
- Write React hooks → useEffect patterns and Vercel best practices activate
- Ask about an EIP → EIP reference skill provides inline summaries
- Work on Solana/Anchor → solana-dev and rust-patterns skills activate
- Work on Anchor program → Rust patterns skill with account validation checks

### Compound-Engineering Integration

If you have the compound-engineering plugin installed, this config routes to its agents automatically:

| Need              | Godmode Provides           | Compound Provides               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Solidity security | `/solidity-security` skill | `security-sentinel` agent       |
| Code review       | Rules + patterns           | `kieran-*-reviewer` agents      |
| Performance       | Gas optimization skill     | `performance-oracle` agent      |
| Architecture      | —                          | `architecture-strategist` agent |
| PR workflow       | —                          | `/workflows:review` command     |
| Frontend          | Web3 frontend patterns     | `frontend-design` skill         |
| Git commits       | —                          | `gitbahn` commands              |

Both are triggered automatically via the CLAUDE.md delegation table — no manual routing needed.
